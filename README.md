# OSD_SSG

**OSD_SSG** is a static site generator, implemented as part of Seneca College's OSD600 course.

> An *SSG* is a tool for generating a complete HTML web site from raw data and files, without having to author any HTML by hand. Imagine that you have a folder of text files that you want to turn into a website. An SSG allows you to enter a simple command that creates .html output files from a given set of input files.
